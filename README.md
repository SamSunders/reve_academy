# Reve Academy Application
 ## Explanation of Project

  Reve Academy (reveacademy.org) worked with Prime Digital Academy for our final project. There were four of us in this group who worked on this project. * Matt Bankston * Tara Newberry * Brandon Nuguen * Samantha Sunders (ME)  We had three weeks to create an application for them where they can enter student information in a visually appealing way. Creating the database and making the interface easy to use was the top priorities for our team.   Along with just data entry, Reve is currently going through the accreditation process and wanted a way to collect and analyze data.
 We decided to go with AngularCharts to make this a reality. We needed to have two separate user logins. One for the admins of Reve and another for the teachers in various schools in the district.
 The admin page should be able to do everything the teacher page does including: add students, classes, and schools. They can also edit, and delete also. Along with the teacher view the admins will also be able to see the combination of all the students to see the demographic information.
